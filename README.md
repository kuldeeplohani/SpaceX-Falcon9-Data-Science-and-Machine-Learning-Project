## SpaceX Falcon-9
The Falcon 9 is a two-stage rocket designed and manufactured by SpaceX, which is a private American aerospace manufacturer and space transportation services company founded by Elon Musk. The Falcon 9 rocket is named after the nine Merlin engines that power the first stage of the rocket.

The Falcon 9 is designed to transport satellites and other payloads into orbit around Earth, as well as to support crewed missions to the International Space Station (ISS) and beyond. The rocket can also be used to launch interplanetary missions, such as the Mars mission that SpaceX plans to undertake in the future.

The first stage of the Falcon 9 is designed to be reusable, with the goal of reducing the cost of space launches. After the first stage separates from the second stage, it performs a controlled descent and lands back on Earth, either on a landing pad or on a drone ship in the ocean. The second stage continues on to deliver the payload to its intended orbit.

The Falcon 9 has become a workhorse for SpaceX, with numerous successful launches and re-landings. The rocket has also been used to support commercial and government customers, including NASA, which has contracted with SpaceX to transport astronauts to and from the ISS.
